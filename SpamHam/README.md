# **Spam/Ham Classification Using Naive Bayes**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify text messages as either **spam** or **ham** (legitimate). The model uses the **Bag of Words (BoW)** technique for text representation and the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm for classification, achieving an accuracy of **97%**.

## **Key Features**
- Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using Bag of Words.
- High-performing spam/ham classification.
- Deployed as a Flask web application for real-time predictions.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and preprocessing.
- **Flask**: For web application deployment.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end design.
